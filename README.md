Developing banking services based on technology is an inevitable and objective trend in the era of international economic integration. This paper aims to determine factors impacting the adoption and use of online banking services in Vietnam. This paper uses the structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural network model (ANN) to comprehensively evaluate the linear and non-linear effects of factors on the adoption and use of online banking services in Vietnam. With survey data of 433 customers from 3 key economic areas in Vietnam, the result of the paper shows that the factors of expected efficiency, cost, expected effort, brand image, perceived risk, and social influence impact intention to use online banking services. At the same time, the intention to use online banking services also increases the decision to choose online banking services.
